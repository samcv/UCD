[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/samcv/UCD.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/samcv/UCD)

## What
This is work towards a rewrite of the `ucd2c.pl` script that generates our
Unicode database on MoarVM.

## How do I build this
Install all dependant modules, if you have zef:
`zef --depsonly install .`
Download the Unicode database files:
`perl6 UCD-download.p6`

Generate the C files with
`perl6 UCD-gen.p6`

They will be placed in `./source`

Running `make` will build `bitfield` and `names` and put them in `./build`
